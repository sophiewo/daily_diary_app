Commit: added route returning last entry title. needs refactoring: 

  - need to get rid of "[]" but wanted to move on.

<h1> You've added an entry called: <%= Entry.last_entry %> </h1>

  - would this make sense to call this somewhere else?


Next to get the diary entry body to add to database too.

when create instance of entry in irb it doesn't add it to database just creates instance to use in the view for eg.
